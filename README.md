bob - bob should of pulled from the master. then created his own branch. Bob should of had Alice create and work on her own branch.

Ted had never create any branch , two times he pulled from master and worked there and tried to push directly to master, so he created conflicts .

In the pair Bob and Carol pair programming, Carol failed to navigate Bob to git pull origin master before creating a new branch from master.

Later when Carol was working with Ted they should not have been working directly on the master branch.
